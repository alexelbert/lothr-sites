                    <p>Roughly one and a half hours of scenic drive along small dirt roads from Auckland near Port
                        Waikato, you find Weathertop where Frodo along with companions were attacked by “The Nine”. You
                        will not be able to see it from up close since it is located on private property, but you get a
                        good view from the road.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbiton</h3>
                    <p>A two hour drive from Auckland near the town of Matamata you can find one of the most visited
                        locations from LOTR, Hobbiton. The former movie set has been preserved and maintained since they
                        made the movies. Here you can get yourself a tour and wander around the movieset with a guide,
                        and even have a pint at the Green Dragon.</p>

                    <p>Mt Ngauruhoe is an active volcano located in Tongariro National Park. This is the inspiration
                        used as Mount Doom for LOTR. There are several hiking trails passing this volcano so you can get
                        up close and personal.</p>

                    <p>In Wellington at the bottom of the south island you can find Mt Victoria where a lot of scenes
                        from the movie were shot. Here is where the Hobbits rolled down the hill running away from
                        “Farmer Maggot”. Take your time walking around in this area and you will find may places that
                        seem very familiar to a fan of the movies.</p>
