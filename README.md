## UX

### Strategy

Taking into consideration the core UX principles made me first think of who my target audience is and what features and technologies to implement.

LOTR Filming Locations target users are:

- Age, 18-60
- Has an interest in the LOTR trilogy
- Interested in having something unique to visit while travelling in New Zealand

What these users would be looking for:

- Clear and easily compiled information
- Photos that would incite an interest in actually going there
- Helpful information on how to get there


This website offers all of this, together with an comfortably user experience through links and a clear cut navigation. The information is kept to a minimum to not overwhelm the user.
Since most of the visitors will be travelling the use of mobile device is assumed. Because of this fact the website is made responsive on different screen sizes.

### Scope

The following features will be included in the release to achieve the user and business goals:

- Header and Navigation bar that follows on screen at all times, to navigate the different pages
- Quick introduction with connected links to the correlating sections
- Complete map of new Zealand with all locations marked
- Every locations actual coordinates to be able to copy or just press to be led to the location on google maps
- Links to general information and advice for travelling New Zealand
- Pictures of the locations to have an idea of what to expect when you get to the location
- Links to affiliate social-networking sites
- Contact page to share your thoughts or if you have an addition to contribute

### Structure

This is a multiple page website to allow for quick and easy navigation using the navigation bar that is remaining on screen while scrolling. I made the following choice for information flow 'Home > North Island > South Island > Contact', for making an easy and clear cut decision as a user depending on where you are located. The information is minimal in conjunction with a simple short information text and two clicks away from having the location in your available gps unit. The bottom of the page you have useful links to other websites that can facilitate most of your other needs, access, cost of entry among more. Finally there is a contact page when you as a user can share your thoughts and input that will be useful for further updates for LOTR Filming Locations.

### Skeleton

![Wireframes](images/wireframes.png)

The layout for the north and south island is the same. The website is slightly different from these original wireframes. In the final version I made some changes to the Image section on the 'Home' page included headings and links that take yuo directly to the correlating content. Made an addition of icon links to Github and Linkedin in the footer.

### Surface

The choice for the colour palette is based around different colours that originates from LOTR in different ways. The black and white originated from the style on the most recent releases of the books.
The green and gold was inspired from the movies, to be more precise, the green cloaks the fellowship is wearing and the gold from the one ring. These different colours is presented in a way to make the text and background content to contrast each other for ease of visible use.

I used Google fonts, 'Playfair Display' for the headings and 'Source Sans 3' for all the other text. I ultimately choose these fonts since it looked similar to the fonts that are used for the LOTR books.

## Features

This website is fully responsive across all screens, with an origin point from a mobile perspective. The content is divided up onto four pages represented in the navigation bar. Navigation, footer, background colour and the text colour stay the same across all pages for a consistent design of the website.

### Navbar

The navigation bar is placed on a black background with an off-white text. Highlighted with colour a clear line to indicate where you are currently located across the pages. Hover effect of a colour shift is added to the other options to clearly indicate that it is a link option using the same colour scheme for cohesiveness.

### Home

On this page you get introduced to the website.
The first section is portrayed with a beautiful background image to draw the users attention with a following H2 and p element giving you a brief introduction of what is to be expected. Underneath there is a following section referred as 'index-pictures' where the user is introduced to 3 different locations to draw you in, using an H3 element followed by a p element containing a link to take you to the correlating segment. This section is presented in a vertical manner on mobile devices and horizontal on all larger screens. Lastly you the user is presented to a linked map where you can get a full picture of New Zealand and where all locations are located so as a user you can get a full overview.

### North Island and South Island

This page is made up of a single section containing a main div which contains another div with two child divs, first one containing an img followed by a p/action element with the correlating coordinates with a golden hover effect. Second div containing an H3 followed by a P element describing the portrayed img in the previous div. The same code follows six times over across the page making up it's content. Displayed vertically on mobile devices and in a grid on all larger screens. Image to the left, description on the right.

### Contact

The Contact page is made up of one section element containing a div with an H2 and P element describing what's expected on this page. following this div is a form element asking the user for name and email using the text and email input that has a required attribute with clear labels in front of the text boxes. A textarea element with a placeholder text for the user to type their message, under the textarea a clear indicated submit input named 'send' with a golden hover effect. This page is portrayed on the same green background used throughout the website with all text in an off white color.

### Footer

Footer section in the same across all pages and has the same black and off white color scheme as the navbar. It's made up of a section containing two div elements. One of them contains an unordered list with three links to other useful websites styled to appear as normal text following an icon which indicates to the user that is is a link, same gold colour applies when hovering the link.
